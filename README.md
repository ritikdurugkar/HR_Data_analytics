# Employee_Attrition_Analysis

In this project, I have built a dashboard for understanding the root cause of attrition in the company which helped the company to reduce the attrition rate by 5% by coming up with different strategies.

## Top reasons why Employees switch to other companies

- Better package for their skill set and experience 
- Better work-life balance
- Better Job satisfaction
- Better work culture 

## Other reasons to quit their job

- Health issues
- Maternity break 
- start up ideas


## Some major insights from the Dashboard 

- Labrotory technicians have had the highest departure rate from the company, followed by the sales executive.
- Most of them had very low Job statisfaction 
- Employees in the age group of 26-35 have left the most.
- Employees having salary less than 5K left the most.
- The majority of the employees departed from the company after completing one or two years.
